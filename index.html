				Sonya has had experience being part of a small town community where a lot of people
				 knew her personally since she was the manager of a local shop that many people in
				 town would frequent. She accomplished a reliable experience for customers to come
				 and enjoy eating lunch with friends and family all while doing her best to 
				 brighten up their day!

			<div class = embelishment>
				<p>	<img src="biositeimages/goals/pray.jpg"/>
				Sonya believes in the power of positivity and prayer. A little prayer and 
				positivity goes a long way and can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life. 
				Instead of worrying about it she says you should pray about it.
