				<p>Sonya is a mother to two boys, James who is 32, and Chris who is 31. They are 
					the same age each year for 12 days. She was called Sam when she was a kid by 
					her grandfather although now, she only has a few people who will call her that 
					today. She said, “My favorite people call me Momma.” She has two dogs one who 
					loves to chase squirrels and another who is part German Sheppard. Their names 
					are Moo Moo short for Mooch and Sassy. She is a sports fan and loves the 
					Clemson Tigers. She’s not extremely passionate about any specific causes. Sonya
					 is most proud of spending over 35 years working with the public. She made a 
					 great deal of money being a manager for over 20 years. She said, “I say it’s a
					 great accomplishment for a woman with only a high school education.” She 
					 hopes to be able to retire soon and finally get to relax. Sonya gave this 
					 advice to young professionals, “Go to college and find something you’re 
					 passionate about because then you won’t have to work a day in your life.” 
					 Having worked with the public Sonya enjoyed meeting people with many 
					 different personalities and said she believes it makes her a better judge of 
					 character. She enjoyed going on vacation to the beach when she was younger 
					 although now, she loves the mountains as well. She believes the laid-back and 
					 reliable community is what she loved when she lived there. Sonya also said, 
					 “As the lyrics from Chris Young’s song voices say, say a prayer every time you
					  lay down at night.”
